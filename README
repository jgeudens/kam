INSTALLATION
------------
Execute install.sh. This script will do all necessray stuff: install packages,
copy the python script to /usr/sbin/kamd, install the initscript to
/etc/init.d/kam and start the service. The service will automatically start
when the computer boots.

CONFIG FILE
-----------
The config file is a ini-like file. It contains 4 main sections. The config
file is located at /etc/kam/config.cnf. When the daemon is started the first
time and no config file exists, a default one is created.

The config file:
[general]
	This section contains general configurations
period = 60
	{x seconds}
	period is a integer value which defines the interval in which the
	monitor tests the cpu, network and processes parameters.
idle_time = 15
	{x minutes}
	The allowed idle time of the computer. When the computer is idle
	for at least this time, the computer will execute the command defined
	in the [idle] section

[cpu]
total_load = 10
	{x%}
	The total load reaches this value, the computer isn't idle.
	Keep in mind this is a sum. So if you have 2 (virtual) cores,
	the maximum value is 200.
per_cpu_load = 5.0
	{x%}
	When at least one core reaches this load, the computer isn't idle
	anymore.

[processes]
	Here you can define processes. When one or more of these processes
	are running, the computer is not idle.
processes = sshd
	A ; separated list of processes to watch, eg:
	sshd;vlc;telnet;ftpd
sshd_min = 2
	For each process defined in 'processes' you can define a minimum value.
	This value tells how many instances of this process must run before
	the computer is not idle. sshd for instance has always one process
	running, so setting this value to 1 will keep your computer awake
	forever. Setting this value to 2, the computer is only awake when
	at least one ssh connection is running.
	This parameter is available for each process defined in 'processes'
	and their name is {process}_min, where {process} is replaced by
	the process name.

[network]
download_speed = 10
	{x KiB/s}
	When the download speed reaches this value, the computer is not idle.
upload_speed = 10
	(x KiB/s}
	When the upload speed reaches this value, the computer is not idle.

[idle]
	Here you can define stuff to do when the computer is idle for
	'idle_time' minutes.

cmd = shutdown -h now
	The command to execute when the computer is idle for 'idle_time minutes'
	This line is executed inside a bash environment. You can execute
	multiple command by separating them by a ';'.
