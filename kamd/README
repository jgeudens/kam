INSTALLATION
------------
Execute "setup.py install" (without quotes) as a root user. This script will
will check if all necessary tools are installed (python3 and psutil for
python3), copy the python script to /usr/sbin/kamd, install the initscript to
/etc/init.d/kam. The service is NOT automatically started when installing.
However, after the installation the script will automatically start in future
boots. So either you reboot the server/computer or you use the command
"service kam start" as root to start the service after installation.

CONFIG FILE
-----------
You can find up-to-date information in the example config file itself.
